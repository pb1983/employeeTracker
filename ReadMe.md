## Description

The Employee Tracker is a simple yet effective Content Management System that allows for navigation and manipulation of a mySQL company database through the command line terminal. Once executed, the user has the option of viewing individual mySQL tables, adding departments/roles/employees to the database, or changing the role of an individual employee. The use of asynchronous functions ensures that the content will not be delivered or augmented prior to input from the operator. The connection between node.js and mySQL via the 'mysql2' client enables the changes to persist in mySQL regardless of whether the Employee Tracker is online.
